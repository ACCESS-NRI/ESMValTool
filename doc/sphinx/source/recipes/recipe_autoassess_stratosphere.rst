Autoassess Stratosphere
=======================

Overview
--------

Polar night jet / easterly jet strengths are defined as the maximum / minimum wind
speed of the climatological zonal mean jet, and measure how realistic the zonal
wind climatology is in the stratosphere.

Extratropical temperature at 50hPa (area averaged poleward of 60 degrees) is important
for polar stratospheric cloud formation (in winter/spring), determining the amount of
heterogeneous ozone depletion simulated by models with interactive chemistry schemes.

The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a good measure of tropical variability in the
stratosphere.  Zonal mean zonal wind at 30hPa is used to define the period and amplitude
of the QBO.

The tropical tropopause cold point (100hPa, 10S-10N) temperature is an important factor in
determining the stratospheric water vapour concentrations at entry point (70hPa, 10S-10N),
and this in turn is important for the accurate simulation of stratospheric chemistry and
radiative balance.

Age of air diagnoses how well the stratospheric meridional mass circulation is simulated,
important for the simulated thermal structure of the stratosphere and the distribution of
chemical species throughout the stratosphere.

The recipe takes as input a control model and experimental model, comparisons being made
with these two CMIP models; additionally it can take observational data s input, in the
current implementation ERA-Interim.

Inputs and usage
----------------
The ``stratosphere`` area metric is part of the ``esmvaltool/diag_scripts/autoassess`` diagnostics,
and, as any other ``autoassess`` metric, it uses the ``autoassess_area_base.py`` as general purpose
wrapper. This wrapper accepts a number of input arguments that are read through from the recipe. 

This recipe is part of the larger group of Autoassess metrics ported to ESMValTool
from the native Autoassess package from the UK's Met Office. The ``diagnostics`` settings
are almost the same as for the other Atoassess metrics.

.. note::

   **Time gating for autoassess metrics.**

   To preserve the native Autoassess functionalities,
   data loading and selection on time is done somewhat
   differently for ESMValTool's autoassess metrics: the
   time selection is done in the preprocessor as per usual but
   a further time selection is performed as part of the diagnostic.
   For this purpose the user will specify a ``start:`` and ``end:``
   pair of arguments of ``scripts: autoassess_script`` (see below
   for example). These are formatted as ``YYYY/MM/DD``; this is
   necessary since the Autoassess metrics are computed from 1-Dec
   through 1-Dec rather than 1-Jan through 1-Jan. This is a temporary
   implementation to fully replicate the native Autoassess functionality
   and a minor user inconvenience since they need to set an extra set of
   ``start`` and ``end`` arguments in the diagnostic; this will be phased
   when all the native Autoassess metrics hanve been ported to ESMValTool
   review has completed.

An example of standard inputs as read by ``autoassess_area_base.py`` and passed
over to the diagnostic/metric is listed below.

Results from ``u-bc179`` have been obtained by running the native Autoassess/stratosphere
on ``.pp`` data from the UKESM` ``u-bc179`` suite and are listed here to confirm the 
compliance between the ported Autoassess metric in ESMValTool and the original native metric.

(*) Note that for ESMValTool results for Polar and Easterly jets ``AERmonZ`` data was used to
compare with native Autoassess since for those metrics very low air pressures are needed (order 5 Pa);
standard CMOR Amon is gridded on ``plev17`` that is lowest at 100 Pa.
