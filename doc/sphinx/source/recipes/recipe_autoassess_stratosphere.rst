Autoassess Stratosphere
=======================

Overview
--------

Polar night jet / easterly jet strengths are defined as the maximum / minimum wind
speed of the climatological zonal mean jet, and measure how realistic the zonal
wind climatology is in the stratosphere.

Extratropical temperature at 50hPa (area averaged poleward of 60 degrees) is important
for polar stratospheric cloud formation (in winter/spring), determining the amount of
heterogeneous ozone depletion simulated by models with interactive chemistry schemes.

The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a good measure of tropical variability in the
stratosphere.  Zonal mean zonal wind at 30hPa is used to define the period and amplitude
of the QBO.

The tropical tropopause cold point (100hPa, 10S-10N) temperature is an important factor in
determining the stratospheric water vapour concentrations at entry point (70hPa, 10S-10N),
and this in turn is important for the accurate simulation of stratospheric chemistry and
radiative balance.

Age of air diagnoses how well the stratospheric meridional mass circulation is simulated,
important for the simulated thermal structure of the stratosphere and the distribution of
chemical species throughout the stratosphere.

Inputs and usage
----------------
This recipe is part of the larger group of Autoassess metrics ported to ESMValTool
from the native Autoassess package from the UK's Met Office. The ``diagnostics`` settings
are almost the same as for the other AUtoassess metrics. An example below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    scripts:
      autoassess_strato_test_1: &autoassess_strato_test_1_settings
        script: autoassess/autoassess_area_base.py  # the base wrapper
        title: "Autoassess Stratosphere Diagnostic Metric"  # title
        area: stratosphere  # assesment area
        control_model: UKESM1-0-LL-hist  # control dataset name
        exp_model: UKESM1-0-LL-piCont  # experiment dataset name
        obs_models: [ERA-Interim]  # list to hold models that are NOT for metrics but for obs operations
        additional_metrics: [ERA-Interim]  # list to hold additional datasets for metrics
        start: 2004/12/01  # start date in native Autoassess format
        end: 2014/12/01  # end date in native Autoassess format

Observations Data sets
----------------------

ERA-Interim data (Dee et al., 2011) and MERRA data (Rienecker et al., 2011) can be obtained online from ECMWF and NASA respectively.  Monthly mean zonal mean U and T data are required.

Age of air data (Andrews et al., 2001; Engel et al., 2009) is as provided in age_of_air.py of the stratospheric area of auto_assess.
