Please discuss your idea for modifications to a diagnostic or recipe with the development team and the author of the diagnostic before getting started, to avoid disappointment later. The best way to do this is to open an issue on GitHub. This is also a good way to get help. 
Note: The author of a recipe can be found in the documentation section of the recipe. Contact information of the author can then be found in esmvaltool/config-references.yml
